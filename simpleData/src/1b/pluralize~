;Problem: Design a function that pluralizes a given word. (Pluralize means to convert the word to its plural form.)
;For simplicity you may assume that just adding s is enough to pluralize a word.

;; String -> String
; pluralizes a given word

(check-expect (pluralize "cat") "cats")
(check-expect (pluralize "c") "cs")

; (define (pluralize s) "dummy") ;stub

;(define (pluralize s) ;template
;  (... s))

(define (pluralize s)
  (+ s "s"))
